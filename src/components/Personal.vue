        What draws me to working as a Software Developer is being able to apply ideas and technologies in both theory and practice. Becoming a programmer has allowed me to leverage code to solve complex and interesting challenges. A good engineer is humble, I know that I can always learn more, but I am also supremely confident in my abilities to lend value immediately.
